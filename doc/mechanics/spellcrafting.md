# Spellcrafting

Unfortunately, I am limited on how much advice I can give when it comes
to writing your own spells.
The structure of sentences and the words you need to use to create spells
will differ based on the world (server/save) you are in.

I can advise you search out [Ancient Tomes](../items/ancient-tome.md), and compare
the effects of the spells within in order to learn more about the words
that make up Spells in your world.
Pay attention to words they may have in common, as well as the placement
of specific types of words within them.

If you are having trouble figuring out what a certain spell does,
it may be worth using an [Identify Scroll](../items/identify-scroll.md)
on them.

Lastly, if you're doing to be making a lot of spells, it probably behooves
you to make a 
[Scriptionary](../items/scriptionary.md)
to record your notes and a
[Writing Desk](../blocks/writing-desk.md)
to do it at.
