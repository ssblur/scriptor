*An Identify Scroll*

Identify Scrolls are a unique item which you use from within the inventory.
These can be found in numerous loot containers in the Overworld, Nether, and
End, or traded from Librarian Villagers with a high trade level.

Use these by picking up the item stack with your mouse and right clicking it
onto the Spellbook you'd like to identify.
2 features of the spell will be identified at once, though it may take
a few tries to identify all of them.
